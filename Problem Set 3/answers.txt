sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: it shows good performance (similar to sort2) when sorting the already sorted files, but the worst performance when sorting the random files

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: it shows the best performance in all three cases

sort3 uses: selection sort
